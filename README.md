# Improved_Pomodoro
A Pomodoro Timer application that emphasizes the users natural attention span and creates breaks appropriate to the time spent working.

Goals:
- Create a timer for students to track their flow state and optimize break time in between.
- Collect data for the user to track focus time, average length of flow states, time spent on individual tasks or projects.
- Create a calender that offers optimal spaced repitition to study for exams or to complete set goals.
- Offer ad free application for students that allows users to utilize all reasources without a paywall.

This is my first project using github so if you stumble upon this README welcome, and I apologize if I struggle a bit with implementation but I'll take any tips I can get.
